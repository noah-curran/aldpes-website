        Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma are two of the oldest and most prestigious national honor societies on the Purdue University Campus.  Both honor societies are rich in history and tradition at hundreds of campuses across the nation.   Phi Eta Sigma was founded in 1923 at the University of Illinois as a freshman honor society designed to promote academic achievement among male students.  Alpha Lambda Delta was originally founded as an honor society strictly for women at the University of Illinois in 1924.  A chapter was founded at Purdue University in 1926.  In the mid-1970s, Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma became co-ed national honor societies.  Each of these societies operates separately at the national level.  However, both Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma operate as one entity on the Purdue University campus, as well as many other campuses across the nation.  The goals of both honor societies are better served when operating as a single team dedicated to academic excellence and community service.

        Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma promotes hard work and dedication in and out of the classroom.  By encouraging incoming freshmen to earn a 3.5 GPA, the honor society creates a strong foundation for later collegiate success.  In addition to helping young college students develop and realize goals within their academic curriculum, Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma encourages students to recognize achievable goals within the community.  Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma and its members participate in a variety of community service projects each year.

        The Purdue University chapter is no exception to this national standard.  Officers and volunteers from the campus chapter offer a well-developed tutoring program for children who reside in Purdue Village.  Serving Thanksgiving dinner at the local homeless shelter, ringing bells for the Salvation Army, and participating in the Relay for Life are just a few of the ever increasing and ever changing examples of the community service performed by Purdue University members. The chapter also participates in a number of campus organization and departmental fairs, including the BGR Business and Organization Fair, PSUB's Activities Bonanza, and the Purdue Scholars Info Fair. Each year, the  chapter officers seek new projects for member involvement.  It is the goal of Alpha Lambda Delta Phi Eta Sigma's Purdue officers to participate in at least one service project each month.

        In 2015, the Purdue Chapter won the First Place Float in the Homecoming Parade. We are very proud of this accomplishment, and it was our first year entering.
